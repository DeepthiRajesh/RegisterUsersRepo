1. Create a class AppSettings in the same folder where appsettings.json exists. 
   Add necessary properties in that class for reading header settings from appsettings.json.
   Make necessary change in startup.cs to set AppSettings class as configuration class.
   Create controller "ConfigurationController" and create a GET api in it to return this header settings.
   From nav menu component, call this api to get header settings 
   and display that in nav menu instead of hard coded items. You will be using ngFor for repeating each item.
